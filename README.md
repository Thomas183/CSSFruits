# Context

This is a website made with plain HTML / CSS and JavaScript (though I decided to use SASS for the css to try it).

It contains multiple exercises that I completed while at Technobel, instead of creating a new project for each exercise, I tought it would be fun to just make some of them accessible on one website with one theme.

It wasn't in the scope of the exercises, but I did use Jquery just for the Navbar because it felt wrong to copy paste it on every page :) because of that, you will need a local http server to run it properly, a simple way of doing that using python 3 is running the following command at the root of the folder: 

```py -m http.server```

or (if you got python from the microsoft store)

```pyton -m http.server```
